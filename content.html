                <h1>My Passion: Cooking and Baking</h1>
                <p>Everyone has a passion. Everyone grows up with something they really enjoy doing, whether it be a sport, writing, travel, singing or another passion. Personally, I have always had a passion for baking. I enjoy cooking meals for my family on days that aren't too busy or even cooking a dessert for celebrations to put a smile on people's faces. In the following paragraphs I will talk about my passion for baking including why I started and what I enjoy baking, what inspires me to continue baking and how I plan to use this skill in the future.</p>
