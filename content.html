                <h1>My Passion: Cooking and Baking</h1>

                <p>Everyone has a passion. Everyone grows up with something they really enjoy doing, whether it be a sport, writing, travel, singing or another passion. Personally, I have always had a passion for baking. I enjoy cooking meals for my family on days that aren't too busy or even cooking a dessert for celebrations to put a smile on people's faces. In the following paragraphs I will talk about my passion for baking including why I started and what I enjoy baking, what inspires me to continue baking and how I plan to use this skill in the future.</p>
                <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always enjoyed baking. For special occasions like New Years, Christmas, Anniversaries and many more, I've always baked some sort of dessert or cooked a meal. I first started baking when my mom would bake fresh chocolate chip cookies for our family when I was really young. She had the best recipe. I used to beg to join her in the kitchen and eventually she taught me everything I know about cooking and baking today. Ever since then, at every occasion I've always cooked or baked something for the family.</p>
                <p>As I said in the previous paragraph, I started baking after watching my mom bake and cook for my family. She first inspired me to start cooking and baking and is the reason that I am able to make all the fancy desserts today. I follow Preppy Kitchen and I've watched so many of his tutorials that help me progess in my baking skills. Everytime I watch one of his videos, I always feel like improving my skills. That is one of my biggest imspirations for baking.</p>
                <p>I am always looking to improve my cooking and baking skills. I test out new recipes all of the time. I plan to use these skills to cook for my family and friends to put a smile on their faces. Since I also have a profound love for coding, I plan to finish building my recipe website to help people when they can't decide what to bake or don't know how to bake. I think that this would be a great use of my skills and is one of the many ways that I can give back to others.</p>
                <p>While we all have our own passions, I think that it is quite important to use them for the common good. Whether you are playing sports, baking, singing or writing, there are so many ways that we can use these passions to give back to our community. Now, I'd like you to think, what is your passion?</p>
